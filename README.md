# nkc_test
  used for testing purpose. i am not a fan of node.js, so in order to test my node.js application without writing lots of callback, i wrote this.
  
# How to
  1. Install VS2012
  2. Build the project
  3. NewtonJSON dll file included, go download your own if you prefer other versions, or this version doesnt work on your platform

  4. Should you have couchDB listening on 5984 and nkc server listening on 1080.
